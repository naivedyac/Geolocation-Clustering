# Geolocation-Clustering
Code for work done as part of an internship at Aadi Shop India from May 4, 2018 to July 4, 2018.
The project in which I was involved consisted of defining key clusters of cabs based on their rank location. The objective behind establishment of the clusters was to find the most optimum spots for building service stations enabling them to serve the maximum number of taxis in their proximity. This kind of optimization problem presents unique challenges throughout the analysis pipeline but is highly effective since multiple enhancements can be integrated later with the basic pipeline.
